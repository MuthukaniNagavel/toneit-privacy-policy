        <h1>Privacy Policy for ToneIT</h1>
        <p class="update-date">Last Updated: December 20, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to ToneIT. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our ringtone maker application. 
            Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>ToneIT is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Audio Files:</strong> The app accesses audio files you select from your device for editing purposes. These files remain on your device and are never uploaded to our servers.</li>

            <li><strong>No Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, or device identifiers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>The audio files you select are used solely for:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Sharing ringtones when you choose to do so</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>All processing happens locally on your device.</strong> No data is sent to external servers.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All audio files and ringtones are stored locally on your device</li>
            <li>We do not maintain any servers or databases that store user data</li>
            <li>Your files remain under your complete control</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>ToneIT may use the following third-party services:</p>
        
        <h3>Android System Services</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>File Picker:</strong> Uses Android's native file picker to let you select audio files</li>
            <li><strong>Share Menu:</strong> Uses Android's share functionality to share ringtones with other apps</li>
            <li><strong>Ringtone Manager:</strong> Uses Android's system to set ringtones</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Future Updates (If Ads Are Added)</h3>
        <p>
            If we add advertisements in future versions, we will use Google AdMob, which may collect device and usage information 
            for ad personalization. We will update this policy and notify users before implementing ads. 
            You can learn more about Google's data practices at:

        </p>

        <h2>6. Permissions Explained</h2>
        <p>ToneIT requests the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Storage/Media Access (READ_MEDIA_AUDIO, READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE):</strong> To access and read audio files you want to edit</li>
            <li><strong>Storage Write (WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE):</strong> To save your created ringtones to your device</li>
            <li><strong>Modify System Settings (WRITE_SETTINGS):</strong> To set your created audio as a ringtone</li>

        <p>These permissions are used only for their stated purposes and are essential for the app to function.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            ToneIT does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. 
            The app is safe for users of all ages.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do not share, sell, or transmit any user data to third parties because we don't collect any personal data. 
            When you use the "Share" feature, you control what is shared and with whom through your device's standard share menu.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>You can revoke app permissions through your device settings</li>
            <li>You can uninstall the app at any time, which removes all app data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy 
            in the app and updating the "Last Updated" date. Significant changes will be announced within the app or through the 
            Play Store update notes.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Analytics and Crash Reporting</h2>
        <p>
            Currently, ToneIT does not use any analytics or crash reporting services. If we add these in the future, 
            we will update this policy and implement appropriate privacy protections.
        </p>

        <h2>12. International Users</h2>
        <p>
            ToneIT operates entirely on your device with no server infrastructure. Your data never leaves your device, 
            so there are no international data transfer concerns.
        </p>
